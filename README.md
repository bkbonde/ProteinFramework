# Recon2Neo4j

<p>The Protein Framework uses the neo4j graph platform for the integration of multiple heterogeneous biological data sources (such as protein-protein interactions, pathways, drug-target interactions, disease-gene interactions, sequence similarity relationships). The integrated network allows the biological context of disease associated genes to be explored through visualisation, and information can be retrieved using the powerful neo4j CYPHER query language.</p>

## How to access the EpiGeNet Framework
The Protein Framework addresses to several categories of users:
<ol>
<li>General user (knowledgebase manager):</li>
The Protein Framework can be accessed online <a href="https://diseaseknowledgebase.etriks.org/protein/browser/"> here</a>.
	<br>A file with several Cypher query examples for the Protein Framework is available for download <a href="protein_framework_sample_queries.docx"> here</a>. These queries can be extended to accommodate specific topics of interest. <br>

	<li> Advanced biological queries:</li>
	For more advanced biological queries and/or further exploration of the results, the Protein Framework can be interrogated directly using java and R. An example of running a simple Cypher query in the Protein Framework using directly R code (via the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RNeo4j/index.html">RNeo4j</a> library): download it <a href="clustering_protein_network.R">here</a>. <br>

### For developers

The Protein Framework is freely available for non-commercial purposes and the java code used to parse the data and populate the graph database is available <a href="https://github.com/ibalaur/ProteinFramework">here</a>.
	
#### Requirements

 - Java 7 
 - Maven (tested with Maven 3.5)

#### Install

After cloning the repository and getting into its directory:

`mvn clean`

`mvn install`
